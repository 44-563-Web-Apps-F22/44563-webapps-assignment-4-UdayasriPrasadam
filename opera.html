<p> rejoice that it's decided,
Happy now will be his life,
For my father is provided
With a true and tender wife.
She will tend him, nurse him, mend him,
Air his linen, dry his tears;
Bless the thoughtful fate that send him
Such a wife to soothe his years!</p>

<h5><div class = "ALE">ALE.</div></h5>           
 <P>No young giddy thoughtless maiden,
Full of graces, airs, and jeers—
But a sober widow, laden
With the weight of fifty years!</P>

<h5><div class = "SIRM">SIRM.</div></h5>           
 <P>No high-born exacting beauty
Blazing like a jewelled sun—
But a wife who'll do her duty,
As that duty should be done!</P>

<h5><div class = "MRSP">MRSP.</div></h5>
<p> I'm no saucy minx and giddy—
Hussies such as them abound—
But a clean and tidy widdy
Well be-known for miles around!</p>

<h5><div class = "DRD">DRD.</div></h5>           
 <p>All the village now have mated,
All are happy as can be—
I to live alone am fated:
No one's left to marry me!</p>

<h5><div class = "ELE">ELE.</div></h5>             
 <p>She will tend him etc.</p>

<c>(Exeunt Sir Marmaduke, Mrs. Partlet, and Aline, with Alexis.  Dr.
Daly
looks after them sentimentally, then exits with a sigh.)</c>

 Enter Mr. Wells<br>

<h5><div class = "MRWLLS">MRWLLS.</div></h5>
<p>Oh, I have wrought much evil with my spells!
And ill I can't undo!
This is too bad of you, J. W. Wells—
What wrong have they done you?
And see—another love-lorn lady comes—
Alas, poor stricken dame!
A gentle pensiveness her life benumbs—
And mine, alone, the blame!</p>

Lady Sangazure enters.  She is very melancholy<br>

<h5><div class = "LADYS">LADYS.</div></h5>           
<p>Alas, ah me! and well-a-day!
I sigh for love, and well I may,
For I am very old and grey.
But stay!
